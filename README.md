# jobq
Generic **job** **q**ueueing.

## Why?
I got sick of seeing people writing bad implementations of job queues for stuff like a Discord bot temporary-mute system or jobs to expire someone's subscription to a product after n days.  

This system has an internal queueing system so you don't have to wait for items "to fire" after the time of the next check. 

## How do I use it?
There's a great example in the [examples directory](examples/)
